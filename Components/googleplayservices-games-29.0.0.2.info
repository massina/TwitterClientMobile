If you are not sure how to find your SHA1 fingerprints, visit the documentation on [Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints][2].\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Manifest \n================\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require specific metadata, attributes, permissions or features to be declared in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file.\n\nThese can be added manually to the *AndroidManifest.xml* file, or merged in through the use of assembly level attributes.\n\n\nFor Play Games you will need to add the *App ID* you generated previously as metadata to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file.  You can add this by including the following assembly level attribute in your app:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: MetaData (\"com.google.android.gms.games.APP_ID\", Value=\"YOUR-APP-ID\")]\n```\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n==========\n\nYou can learn more about the various Google Play Services SDKs \u0026 APIs by visiting the official [Google APIs for Android][3] documentation\n\n\nYou can learn more about Google Play Services Games by visiting the official [Play Games Services SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) documentation.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://console.developers.google.com/ \"Google Developers Console\"\n[2]: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/MD5_SHA1/ \"Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints\"\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/android/ \"Google APIs for Android\"\n\n","Hash":"3ee992dc89cf3d9fd5c1071d0ae6b989","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
